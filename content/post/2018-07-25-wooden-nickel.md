I was excited to try out this new book The One Bottle Cocktail by Maggie Hoffman. While each recipe only requires one bottle of alcohol they are anything but simple. The Wooden Nickel is similar to the Exile in Ryeville from the other day but much sweeter. The bourbon instead of rye and the tangerine juice instead of cointreau make for a much sweeter and brighter drink. The tangerine juice was harder to produce then I would have thought. I may have made a mistake peeling the tangerine first.
