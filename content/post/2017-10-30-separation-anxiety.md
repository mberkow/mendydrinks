The weather is finally beginning to turn cooler so I looked for autumn themed cocktail. I found this on the [Boxes and Booze](http://boxesandbooze.blogspot.com/) site. It has the warm spice notes you imagine in a autumn cocktail. The [Besamim Liquor](http://www.sukkahhill.com/) certainly shines. It does need a beefy bourbon to stand up to the spice of the Besamim and the sweet of the Demerara.
