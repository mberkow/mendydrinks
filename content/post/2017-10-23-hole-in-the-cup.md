I enjoy the anise taste of absinthe so I am always on the lookout for cocktails with absinthe in the ingredient list. I'm not a big fan of tequila so I was interested to see how these two would play together. There is enough sweetness in this cocktail to balance the sharpness of the absinthe and you get a fun give and take between the agave and anise.
