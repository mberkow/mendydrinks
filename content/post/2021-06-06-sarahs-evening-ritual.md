While not a nightly ritual, setting out the bar mat, browsing my recipe queue, gathering the tools and ingredients has been a relaxing ritual to end the day. Even the post drink clean up is part of the moment of zen. Somewhere between a mint julep and an old fashion each sip alternates between the two.
