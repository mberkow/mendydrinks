It isn't often that I come across a recipe with orange juice. I was worried that the color on this drink would be very dark. But never underestimate the coloring powers of Campari. Also never underestimate the bittering factor of Campari. This is a rather herbaceous drink with the juniper from the gin, the bitter from the amaro and Campari all overwhelming the orange juice.
