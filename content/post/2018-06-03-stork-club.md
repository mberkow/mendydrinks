After a month off for an impromptu dry May I'm back in the saddle. My supply of syrups and juices has been depleted so I needed to find a straight forward recipe with common ingredients. The Stork Club fits the bill nicely. The cocktail has a gorgeous color and is well balanced. Not too sweet and not too tart. It's good to be back mixing drinks.
