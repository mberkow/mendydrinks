The first thing you notice about this drink is the color, a beautiful dark red. The second thing you notice is the great balance of sweet/sour between the grenadine and lime. I'm going to note down that ratio for future reference. Next time though I'm going to double all the measures, this was delicious but there wasn't enough!

* 1 1/2 oz Peated Whiskey
