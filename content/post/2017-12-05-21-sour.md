Usually I forget about Repeal Day, not this year. A Repeal Day cocktail needs whiskey or gin as its base spirit. While in Vegas last week I had an interesting take on a whiskey sour that used marmalade as the sour agent rather than citrus. I added a little bit of cinnamon syrup and I have the 21 Sour. 21 for the amendment and sour because I like whiskey sours.
