Went to the Death & Co [book](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Co-Modern-Classic-Cocktails/dp/1607745259) this evening. It is fun when you can look at a recipe and understand why the creator added the ingredients that they did. This is a fun drink. It has a bunch of alcohol so it goes into a highball with plenty of ice. The strong flavors of the Amaro and Cherry Heering are balanced by the lemon juice, but the simple syrup makes sure it isn't sour. While the bourbon gives the baseline depth. A fun and easy cocktail.
