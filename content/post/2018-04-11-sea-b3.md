I've wanted the [Death & Co](http://www.deathandcompany.com/home) book for quite a while. When I got an unexpected Amazon gift card I decided to treat myself. The book itself is beautiful and the content is tremendously fun. I'm not sure which I enjoyed more, the essays from the regulars or the description of a typical 24 hours at the bar. But the best part was flipping to a random page and finding a perfect cocktail for my mood. The orange juice gets a little lost in the rum but this is a wonderful drink.
