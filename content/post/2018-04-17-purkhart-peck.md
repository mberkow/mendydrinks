According to my notes this is drink number 200. A surprise since it has not seemed like that long since I've started this journey. But it is almost exactly two years since my first post on Instagram. I don't think my photography has improved but the range of ingredients and the number of bottles in my bar certainly has grown. I've made multiple syrups from scratch, experimented with clear ice and expanded by glassware collection. Maybe tomorrow I'll post a statistical break down of the 200 cocktails but tonight we drink!

I wanted a cocktail that contained bourbon so I turned fittingly turned to Drunk & Told where I found this simple tasty cocktail. Fredric has been a tremendous source of inspiration and recipes. I like how apricot mixes with bourbon and the vermouth drys the drink down.
