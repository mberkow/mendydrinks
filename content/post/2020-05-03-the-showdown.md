Usually cocktails call for a dash of bitters, this one called for a 1/2 ounce. It takes a lot of sugar to counter the bitterness so the rum, simple syrup and even the lemon juice take the bite out. Even so I paired it with some homemade peanut chews my daughter made and was not overwhelmed by sweetness.
