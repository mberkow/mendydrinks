I enjoy comparison tasting. Taking a cocktail and swapping one ingredient to see how the balance and taste change is loads of fun. This is one of the many reasons I've been enjoying [The Joy of Mixology](https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Mixology-Consummate-Guide-Bartenders/dp/0609608843). Here is the Maiden's Prayer which is related to the Maiden's Blush. I prefer this version which is not as sweet.
