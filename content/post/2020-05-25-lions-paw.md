I have a slew of recipes in the queue that call for cinnamon syrup. After I made a fresh batch today this cocktail was up first. Another crisp summer cocktail. The recipe called for serving it over crushed ice tiki style but since the inspiration was from an old fashioned I went that direction and poured it over my new "diamond" shaped ice cube. The lime and cinnamon went well together bound by the nuttiness of the orgeat.
