I finally took the plunge and used egg whites. I've had it before in bars but never had the courage to add them at home. My first attempt at a dry shake didn't go as well as I'd liked as the shaker didn't quite seal. But once I cleaned up the mess the result was tasty and looked great.

* 1 1/2 oz Amaro
