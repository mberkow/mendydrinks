* 3 dashes Angostura Bitters
* 3/8 oz Maple Syrup
* 1 oz Islay Scotch (Laphroig)
* 1 oz Bourbon (Heaven Hill BiB)

Trying to get back into the saddle with this no muss no fuss cocktail. Built in the glass with readily available ingredients. Maple syrup goes well with smokey flavors and once the dilution started the Laphroig no longer overpowered the drink.
