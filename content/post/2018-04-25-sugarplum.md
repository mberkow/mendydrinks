It's time for me to start experimenting with different types of gin. I used Plymouth Gin in this recipe to avoid some of the overly juniper notes and allow the juices to shine. I didn't even attempt the garnish displayed in the original but this was a really tasty drink. You get the sweetness of the juices followed by the bite of the gin.
