As I was making this drink I though it would be sweet but it really isn't. Rye cuts down the sweetness in a way bourbon or rum couldn't.

I usually don't bother with fancy garnishes when I'm mixing a single drink. But I had some extra time tonight so I decided to give this cocktail its due. Garnish is a skill like any other and needs practice. Any tips for practicing glass rimming?
