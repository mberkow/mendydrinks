Eighteen months ago I decided to start making cocktails. I've been recording of them on a [instagram account](https://instagram.com/mendy_drinks) in a rather sparse fashion. Long enough that it is time to add a little more verbosity. I've created a web page and will start using hashtags. Lets see where this goes.

I came to this via whiskey so it is appropriate to feature a whiskey forward cocktail. This tasted similar to a whiskey sour but the orgeat added a sweeter, nuttier flavor
