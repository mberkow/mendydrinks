I can't remember the last cocktail I made without a syrup or juice of some sort. I wasn't sure why a drink with so many seemingly sweet components would have a name like "Old Ironsides". But this cocktail has a pleasant dark old leather aroma and taste. The amaretto comes in at the end to give just a little bit of nuttiness.
