Similar to the [Sensation](https://www.mendydrinks.com/2020/07/12/sensation/) which was similar to the [Leapfrog](https://www.mendydrinks.com/2020/07/08/leapfrog/). I liked the weighty amount of Angostura in this drink. Today is the last day this year the sun will set after 8pm. Felt appropriate to sip this outside watching the airplanes and listening to the ball game.
