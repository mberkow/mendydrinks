I've had this cocktail on the queue for a while. A friend shared a menu from a bar that was completely Halloween themed so I played along with the Corpse Reviver. Equal ratio cocktails are easy to make and this one wasn't overly dry or tart. 

{{< figure src="/images/2017-10-19-corpse-reviver-no-2.jpg" >}}

* 3/4 oz Gin
* 3/4 oz Dry Vermouth
* 3/4 oz Triple Sec (Cointreau)
* 3/4 oz Lemon Juice
* Dash of Absinthe

From the Savoy Cocktail book.
