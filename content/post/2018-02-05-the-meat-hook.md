Instagram post #200. I didn't think I would reach this post. I started of as basic as a new person could begin. Along the way I've branched out in ingredients, equipment and composition. Much thanks to all the instagram mixologists and bartenders who provided inspiration and recipes. Looking forward to the next 200 posts!
