I always enjoy a good old fashioned riff. The quicker and simpler to construct the better. This was a nice sipper while I worked the grill before dinner. I think I need to recalibrate my "dashes" or my "rinses" as the bitters got lost behind the mezcal/absinthe rinse.

* 2 oz Tequila
* 1 Tsp Simple Syrup
* 2 dash Peycauds Bitters
* 2 dash Angustora Bitters
* Absinthe & Mezcal rinse
