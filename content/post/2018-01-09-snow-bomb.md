After surviving the "bomb cyclone" I'm glad for [Tiki the snow away](https://www.instagram.com/tikithesnowaway/) to help melt  the last flakes. My contribution is the Snow Bomb. I wanted the cocktail to be red not brown so I used a white rum. But I also wanted some spice so I added the Besamim Liqueur. I was aiming for a sweeter result but overall I was pleased with the result.
