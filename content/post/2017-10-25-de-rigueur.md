A while ago my cousins bought me a set of ["bartender glasses"](https://kikkerland.com/collections/kitchen-bar/products/bartending-glasses-set-of-4) from MOMA. I needed to make room and toss the box so I decided to stage a quick photo shoot. Turns out the De Rigueur is also a Savory cocktail with several takes on the proportions of ingredients.
