Iâ€™ve scrolled by this recipe in my queue for a while, always missing at least one ingredient. Finally the perfect storm of berry supply unlocked this delicious cocktail. It was not as boozy as the two ounces of bourbon might suggest. Loads of berry flavor and not overly sweet

{{< figure src="/images/2018-08-29-american-berry-smash.jpg" >}}

* 1 oz Bourbon
* 1 oz Wild Turkey American Honey
* 1 Strawberry
* 10 Blueberries
* 1/2 Lemon quartered
* 1/4 oz Honey Syrup

Muddle the fruits with the Honey Syrup. Add the alcohol, shake, double strain into a rocks glass.
