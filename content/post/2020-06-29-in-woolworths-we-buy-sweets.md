I thought I shook this long enough to get the foamy head but if I tripled my usual shake I must need to add several orders of magnitude. This cocktail has the velvety mouthfeel from the rum and pineapple. The Campari punches up the tartness of the pineapple and limes. Next time with the long shake I need to use a little less ice to prevent dilution.
