I stumbled across this straight forward recipe in the Savoy Cocktail book. I enjoyed the way the orange of the Cointreau plays with the anise of the absinthe. I used 1 oz portions and had exactly enough in the bottle of Cointreau. Thatâ€™s what you get when you measure everything. Not sure what I would have done if I needed more.
