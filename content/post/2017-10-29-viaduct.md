Sometimes I bookmark a recipe with the intention of making the cocktail when we end up with the ingredients in the house and the completely forget. When my wife had a little bit of apricot jam left after a baking recipe it tickled my memory about this drink. I didn't have Curacao so substituted Cointeau instead. The drink came out a little more tart than I would have expected.

* 1 1/2 oz Gin
* 1/2 oz Curacao (Cointreau)
* 1/2 oz Lime Juice
