We had some [Godiva Chocolate Liquor](https://www.godivaliqueurs.com) left over from a baking recipe. I found this cocktail on their website. The classic combination of strawberries and chocolate was overly sweet. The strawberries did come through the chocolate but the sweetness was hard to get past. The cocktail did not come out as dark as I imagined but I tried to "float" my garnish above the surface of the drink. Idea was good, execution not so much.
