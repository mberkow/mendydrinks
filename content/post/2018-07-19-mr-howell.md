A while ago a sharp eyed viewer spotted the Star Wars Lego figurine my son left the shot. That happy accident is an ant next to the giant that is [Scotch Trooper](https://www.patreon.com/scotch_trooper). I noticed that his posts had declined but nothing prepared me for the reason. I watched his interview on [Scotch Test Dummies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVn7RecqdhQ) a couple of days ago and was amazed at the story. I alternated between sadness over what had happened and anger over the bullying of an artist. I'm going to try and find away to support his work and so should you. #istandwithtrooper #wesupportyouscotchtrooper

On the first taste of the Mr. Howell you get the smoke from the scotch but then the maple syrup comes through. This is a well balanced cool cocktail.
