Since the cocktail is “fancy” I decided to be more fancy than usual. I don’t usually double strain when I make a cocktail but I did this time. I also flamed the orange peel as directed. I couldn’t really taste either but visually the drink looked nice for having been double strained. The cocktail starts off with bright orange flavors with the Campari bringing up the rear.
