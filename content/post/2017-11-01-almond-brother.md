I would have though this cocktail would be too sweet or too nutty with both orgeat and amareto. But the tequila does come through at the end of a sip. It is fun to mix a cocktail with half a dozen ingredients. I didn't realize how many components were involved until after I had lined them all up before I began mixing.
