Today is the first of the intermediate days of the Succot holiday. So of course I have several Etrog themed cocktails in the queue. Hopefully the weather holds up and I'll be able to take some photos outside in my Succah. I'm a big fan of the Scofflaw in general so this entry from [@higproofpreacher](https://instagram.com/highproofpreacher) was a no brainer.
