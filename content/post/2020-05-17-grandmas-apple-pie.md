This does really taste like apple pie. I might add a 1/4 oz of cinnamon syrup instead of dusting. I do wish there was a way to make it a bit thicker. Having the apple garnish would give it a bit of a crunch.

* 2 oz Bourbon
* 1/2 oz Triple Sec
* 1/4 oz Creme de Cacao
* 1 oz Apple Juice

Stir and dust with cinnamon
