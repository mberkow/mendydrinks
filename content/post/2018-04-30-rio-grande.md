Some days it's nice to come home and put together a complicated cocktails. Other times you want something simple and easy. It doesn't get any more straight forward than a equal parts three bottle cocktail. This is an excellent recipe to try different styles of Tequila and Gin with. Different brands would make a huge difference in this drink.
