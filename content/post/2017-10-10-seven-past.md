Third in my Succot themed cocktails. I made this on the seventh and last day of the holiday. I wanted to reflect on the being the day the holiday moves into the past. A bunch of years ago my parents developed the habit of putting the Etrogim in bowl to dry out. When I got a home of my own I continued the practice.
