With a big winter storm incoming we continue with the berry theme. The blackberries are real fragile and plump. You don't need to muddle them at all and you have to be careful not to crush them while washing. Double straining is a must! This recipe has plenty of berry flavor and is refreshingly cool. Come the summer time I'll premake a big batch and bring it to the beach.
