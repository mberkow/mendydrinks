With the first snow of the year I flipped through my bookmarks looking for a good Besamim recipe. The North Star from [Garnish Girl](http://www.garnishblog.com/) has hints of smoke from the mezcal and the warming spice of the Besamim. The lemon juice adds a brightness to a wonderful cocktail for sitting inf ront of the fire.
