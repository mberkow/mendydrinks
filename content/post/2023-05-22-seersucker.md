Years ago I found the Death and Co book at my local library and copied down several recipes. Now the stars aligned as I have the book and all the ingredients. In the description the drink is served in a pilsner glass with crushed ice. To control the dilution the instructions call for shaking with only three ice cubes. A detail I didnâ€™t notice when I first read the recipe.
