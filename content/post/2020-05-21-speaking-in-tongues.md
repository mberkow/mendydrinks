Continuing to try and and work on my techniques. Double straining is absolutely required when muddling but I think I might start always double straining into a cocktail glass or coupe. The result looks cleaner and crisper. The smoke from the mezcal goes real well with the herbs in the amaro. I muddled two strawberries instead of one and was happy with the result.
