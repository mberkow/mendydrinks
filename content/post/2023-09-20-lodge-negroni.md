While there are many more posts on this account by my calculations this is cocktail number 300. 

I missed the other century milestones so as I approached this one I felt some self imposed pressure to do something “special” to mark the occasion. This pressure led to some trepidation and it was with some anxiety that I looked for a recipe. With this being #negroniweek I pulled this off the hopper from what may be my most used source (thanks [@fredericyarm](https://www.instagram.com/fredericyarm) for all the inspiration).

My first post was over seven years ago. I’ve built up my bar, my tool chest and my skill set. While my engagement with cocktails has ebbed and flowed over the years it has never not been fun. One version of me would have published a full blog post of stats and data but instead I just enjoyed a nice cocktail with a good friend.

L’Chaim!
