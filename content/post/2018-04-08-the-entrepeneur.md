Back in the saddle after the Passover break. The sweet notes of the grenadine and maple syrup are balanced by the lemon. I'm still trying to get a handle on how different sugars are offset by sours. Rye is a perfect alcohol for this mixture, it doesn't get lost in the other flavors. My garnish game isn't quite as good as the original.
