I love equal parts cocktails. By adding the ingredients in order this starts off like a highball and ends like a much stronger drink.

{{< figure src="/images/2022-07-06-golden-friendship.jpg" >}}

* 1 oz Amaretto
* 1 oz Sweet Vermouth
* 1 oz Rum
* 1 oz Ginger Ale

Fill collins glass with ice. Add ingredients in order and garnish with orange slice
