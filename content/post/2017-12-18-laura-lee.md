Many people are posting their favorite book purchases of 2017 so I went to my favorite purchase [Drink & Tell](https://www.amazon.com/Drink-Tell-Boston-Cocktail-Book/dp/0988281805/). This is an excellent book with many accessible recipes from the Boston scene. Lots of dark stone fruit in this drink which is unsurprising given the ingredient list. The rye got lost amongst the liquors and I wonder if a tequila or rum would lend more of an influence.
