The alcohol is completely masked in this cocktail. Even with a strong rye whiskey the taste of alcohol is covered by the orange, almond and lemon flavors. This is the second cocktail I made with my "frozen" orgeat. After making a batch of orgeat I froze half the batch in an ice tray. With enough notice I can remove one of the "cubes" and have orgeat without worrying about spoilage.
