Tonight I picked another cocktail with Campari. With so many recipes to choose from I find myself selecting an ingredient to highlight and then searching for cocktails that contain that ingredient.

* 2 oz Pineapple Juice
* 1/2 oz Lime Juice
* 1/2 oz Simple Syrup
* 3/4 oz Campari
* 1 1/2 oz Dark Rum
