I spotted the Pete's Word in the Death & Co book and was drawn to the combination of peat and lime. Peat and Maraschino go well together, the dark cherry notes of the Maraschino blend with the smokiness of the Scotch. As they mention in the book, the lime and peat shouldn't make sense but works well.

Instead of the Green Chartreuse called for in the book I switched in Etrog Liquor. I've been meaning to test Etrog Liquor as a Chartreuse substitute for a while and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. However, I wasn't sure if this departure was enough to warrant a new name. I've swapped styles of rum or gin in the past without changing the cocktail name. So I consulted with a friend who helps me arbitrate all things cocktail. We figured the citrus of the Etrog was different enough from the herbal Chartreuse required a name change. Let me know in the comments your thoughts. How much of a deviation demands a new name?
