This recipe calls for "runny honey" but didn't quite explain how that was made. So I took 1/2 oz of honey and added 1/4 of hot water. Once I was fiddling with the ingredients I decided to fiddle with the garnish as well. This is a boozy drink and the Gin shines through the sweetness of the honey and apple juice.
