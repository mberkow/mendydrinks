The 'bomb cyclone' did not disappoint. I'm not sure how much snow we got as the drifting snow was all over the place. I was standing on the clear bricks of my patio and six feet away was a four foot drift. After clearing my house (with a snow blower), picking up my brother from a stranded LIRR train and digging out my parents cars (without a snow blower) I was ready for a hot drink. But I was too tired to find a recipe so I made up my own. A fitting inauguration of my High West cut. I didn't even measure the ingredients. Not the booziest drink but certainly warming and sweet, which after all is the whole point.

* Hot Water
* A healthy shot of High West Rendezvous Rye
