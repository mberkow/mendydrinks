After several days in a row of sub freezing temperatures I was happy to attempt Hot Buttered Rum for the first time. There are many recipes out there so I turned to a trusted source. I tried several times but could not float a tab of the batter on top. Also note to self, using a metal measuring cup with hot water is a bad idea.

* 2 oz Rum
* 8 oz hot water
