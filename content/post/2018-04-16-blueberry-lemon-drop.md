While you wouldn't know from the weather outside it is currently spring. So let's try to encourage mother nature with a spring cocktail. The was wonderfully tart, almost a berry lemonade. Next time I'll make this with gin to get a little more botanical flavor.

* 1 1/2 oz Vodka
* 3/4 oz Lemon Juice
* 1/2 oz Triple Sec
