I picked up The One-Bottle Cocktail a while ago and there are so many good recipes. This one called for concord grapes which I did not have so I tried to adjust the count to accommodate. The grape flavors shine through. This is a crisp refreshing cocktail for a summers day. I think it has a little too much lime and would make it 1/2 oz next time.
