This cocktail has a wonderful aroma, the freshness of the mint with the smoke of the scotch. The little bit of licorice from the absinthe gives the extra subtle finish with every sip. I usually find cocktails that call for peaty scotch get overwhelmed by the smoky flavors. This cocktail does a good job balancing the smoke with the other flavors.
