Even though it is December it is not yet officially winter so this Autumn Daiquiri is still in season. You certainly get the lime on the first sip with the cinnamon hinting in the background, the pineapple gets a little lost. The recipe called for bitters but it probably could do without.

* 2 oz Rum
* 1/2 oz Pineapple Juice
