An uninspiring looking drink. But very interesting after the first sip. You get the sweetness of the vermouth, applejack and maraschino. But even the small amount of fernet prevents the sweetness from becoming overwhelming without resorting to sours or bitters. The mouthfeel has a nice viscosity and weight.
