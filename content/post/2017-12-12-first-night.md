Tonight marks the first night of Chanukah, celebrating the victory of the few over the many. One of the recent traditions is to eat doughnuts, specifically jelly doughnuts. I wanted to make a cocktail that paid some homage to that tradition. So I threw together some gin, strawberry jam and lemon juice. The result was a little more tart than I was aiming for so I will certainly add some simple syrup or maybe some muddle strawberries in the next edition.
