I'm lucky to live in a city with several world class cocktail bars. Even so it is sad when one has to close. The other day the Dead Rabbit was impacted by a fire in an adjoining building. Hopefully they will be back up and running soon. So in tribute I choose a cocktail from the Dead Rabbit Drinks Manual. The Hunter is a perfect representation of a great Dead Rabbit cocktail. Pretty to look at, plenty of booze, based on a classic, complex and makes you want to keep sipping.
