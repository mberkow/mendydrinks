When the temperature is well below freezing you turn to Islay for the warming smoky flavors. The dark cherry balances the smoke from the peat. The Besamim is a great choice of sweeting agent lending more character than a simple syrup. Most recipes don't fit as perfectly as this one did in my coupe glasses.
