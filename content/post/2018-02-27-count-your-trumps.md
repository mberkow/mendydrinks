The name of this cocktail might as well have been bittersweet. Bittersweet is the perfect word to describe the flavor mix of the Campari and the Amaretto. The nutty bitterness is perfect. While the recipe calls for equal parts of Campari and Amaretto it is an easy one to tweak. If you like bitter make it a fat 3/4 oz of Campari. Like it sweet? Use a fat 3/4 oz of Amaretto. Couldn't be simpler.
