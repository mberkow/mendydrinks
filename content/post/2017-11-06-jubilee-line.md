I flagged this recipe from the excellent Drink &Tell book in the event we ended up with Marmalade in the house. This is the third drink I’ve made recently with jam or preserves and double straining makes a big difference. I think there was a little too much lemon in this drink or it could be the extra tartness of the Marmalade.
