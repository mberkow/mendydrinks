My employer sent us a gift package to celebrate the anniversary of the companyâ€™s founding. Included was a spherical ice mold. The first time I used it I was impatient and took it out of the freezer early and discovered I could make hollow ice spheres. So of course I had to attempt to put a cocktail in side one. The cocktail was tasty, the execution not so much. Practice and patience makes perfect.
