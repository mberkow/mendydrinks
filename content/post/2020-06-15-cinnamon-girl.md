This might be one of the more involved recipes yet. Multiple spirits? Check. Multiple syrups? Check. Muddling? Check. Crushed Ice? Check. Garnish? Check. The stars aligned and I had all the ingredients on hand in sufficient quantities. I do wonder how to judge adding the right amount of crushed ice before filling the glass with the cocktail. I presume when you do this nightly you get a feel. This starts with the orange notes which mellows into the agave from the tequila. I’m not sure if it’s the rum or the cinnamon that tie the flavors together. They certainly don’t play a leading role but elevate the stars.
