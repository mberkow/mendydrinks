After a renovation I've got the cocktail bar set up once again (minus the glassware). The renovation should have been completed months ago but 2020 was a year. Unfortunatly the bar was out of scope for this renovation but I've made some adjustments to this old TV cabinet that makes it better suited as a bar. While I have grand plans for a permanent bar for now Bar 2.0 will do just fine.
