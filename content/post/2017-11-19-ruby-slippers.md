I'm a big fan of the Etrog Liquor from [Sukkah Hill](http://www.sukkahhill.com/). When I saw this recipe on their feed it immediately went onto the queue. I was worried that the drink would be too sour with both the lemon and the etrog but both are needed to balance the raspberry syrup. I'm not sure how they were able to get the light red color as the raspberry syrup I have is a much darker color.
