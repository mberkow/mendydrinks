Fitz-G-Honeymooner

It has been a while. I made this New Years Eve for some friends to great success. Not quite a spiked lemonade but that is almost certainly the inspiration.


{{< figure src="/images/2024-01-07-fitz-g-honeymooner.jpg" >}}

* 1 1/2 oz White Rum
* 1/2 oz Cointreau
* 3/4 oz Lemon Juice
* 1/2 oz Honey Syrup
