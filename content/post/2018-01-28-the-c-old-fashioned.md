I love each of the [Sukkah Hill](http://www.sukkahhill.com/) products. The Besamim Liqueur reminds of so much of Saturday nights. I would have thought the combination of Besamim and cinnamon would be overpowering. I was wrong, each of the ingredients stands out in this cocktail. My only regret is I didn't have a big ice cube and the drink watered down towards the end.
