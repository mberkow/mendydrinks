* 1 1/2 oz Vodka
* 1/2 oz Applejack
* 3/4 oz Lemon Juice
* 3/4 oz Grenadine
* 1 dash Absinthe

There haven’t been many vodka cocktails on my feed. But true to the description this is a vodka drink for non-vodka drinkers. All of the flavors are well balanced. The lemon alone probably wouldn’t have been enough to counter the sweetness but the absinthe smooths everything over so well.
