* 1 1/2 oz Gin
* 3/4 oz Calvados (Applejack)
* 3/4 oz Apricot Brandy

Following a New York cocktail with an Empire cocktail. Very dry and very boozy. Some of that is probably due to the ingredients I had on hand. I was in the mood for something simple and straight forward. This three bottle cocktail fit the bill.
