Campari is a recent addition to my bar so I was excited to try this martini variation. Though just a small portion of the drink the floral bitterness comes through strong. I think the addition of grapefruit matches the color but lends too much acidity to the cocktail. I might try it with some grenadine or cranberry juice. Or maybe just some simple syrup.
