Many cocktails call for applejack and I have always had to pass them over. So I was estatic to find a kosher certified applejack from Black Dirt. I wanted to start from the basics and of the many versions of the Jack Rose recipe I took the one from Imbibe. The applejack gives this a tang that bourbon or rye could not.
