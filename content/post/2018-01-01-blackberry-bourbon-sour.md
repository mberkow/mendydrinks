It seems that blackberries must be in season as I've seen them in several local stores. Seems strange in the middle of fridged weather. I've several bookmarked recipies that call for blackberries so it seems 2018 will begin with a theme. The first thing I noticed about this cocktail is the beatiful deep purple color. The sour wasn't quite there and I wonder if I had added the egg white as called for by the original recpipe. The agave syrup is a great call as it brings out the berry flavors.
