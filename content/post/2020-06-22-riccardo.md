I enjoy a recipe where all ingredients are in equal parts. After a long day not having to measure multiple amounts is welcome. In the book this is billed as a mezcal take on the Blood and Sand and similar to its namesake the strong flavor of the mezcal more than stands up to the sweetness of the other ingredients. The hot sauce comes it at the end to give a welcome kick.
